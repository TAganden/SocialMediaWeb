# SocialMediaWeb
This is the basic implementation of a Social Media Website. It uses pure php, mysql, css, html, bootstrap and maybe some javascript.
You need to have an apache server running and the databse established with the tables as in the .sql file.

NOTE:
In the upload image part do not upload very large images. The design does not support large files.
Also the image preview is not enabled hence once you browse and select a picture, you need to click upload to see the image you have chosen.

Make sure you add all css files in a folder named css
and all image files in a folder named images.
